This is a really handy tool for creating READMEs within modules. It will take all the variables, outputs, providers and resources used to create a table and description of each item.

This will save a lot of time in the long run but of course it isn't a perfect solution. You will still need to write further documentation should you add anything which isn't covered when running the Terraform-docs command.

It can also be used for various other output mediums, see list below:

```bash
  asciidoc    Generate AsciiDoc of inputs and outputs
  completion  Generate shell completion code for the specified shell (bash or zsh)
  help        Help about any command
  json        Generate JSON of inputs and outputs
  markdown    Generate Markdown of inputs and outputs
  pretty      Generate colorized pretty of inputs and outputs
  tfvars      Generate terraform.tfvars of inputs
  toml        Generate TOML of inputs and outputs
  version     Print the version number of terraform-docs
  xml         Generate XML of inputs and outputs
  yaml        Generate YAML of inputs and outputs
```
