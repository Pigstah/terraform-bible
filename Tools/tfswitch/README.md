This handy tool will switch between Terraform versions with one command. Sometimes with certain projects you have to use a certain versions. Switching between projects with different versions can be cumbersome when having to download Terraform versions manually. With TFSwitch you run one command and append it with the version you want and it installs and switches to that version. 

You can also just run TFSwitch on its own and it will give you a prompt to switch to previous versions.
